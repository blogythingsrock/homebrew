When you use your bite and hit a creature that isn’t a Construct or an Undead, you can empower yourself in one of the following ways of your choice: (1) regain hit points equal to the damage dealt by the bite (2)gain a bonus to the next ability check or attack roll you make; the bonus equals the damage dealt by the bite. You can empower yourself with your bite a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest..</p>
