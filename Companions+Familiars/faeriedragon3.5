 			<p>A faerie dragon is a cat-sized dragon with butterfly wings, it wears a sharp-toothed grin and expresses its delight by the twitching of its tail. The only warning of a faerie dragon's presence is a stifled giggle. The dragon stays out of sight, watching invisibly as its victims contend with its pranks. When its fun is done, the dragon might reveal itself, depending on the disposition of its "prey". A faerie dragon has a sharp mind, fondness for treasure and good company, and a puckish sense of humor. Travelers can play to a faerie dragon's draconic nature of offering  it "treasure" in the form of sweets, baked goods, and baubles in exchange for information or safe passage through its territory. A faerie dragon's scales change hue as it ages, from red when it's 5 years or younger, orange when it's 6-10 years, yellow from 11-20, green 21-30, blue 31-40, indigo 41-50, and violet when they are 51 years or older. All faerie dragons have innate spellcasting abilities.</p>
