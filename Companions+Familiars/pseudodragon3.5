			<p>The elusive pseudodragon dwells in the quiet places of the world, making its home in the hollows of trees and small caves. With its red-brown scales, horns and a maw filled with sharp teeth, a pseudodragon resembles a tiny red dragon but its disposition is playful with a laconic wit. Pseudodragons have little interest in other creatures, and they avoid them whenever possible. If attacked a pseudodragon fights back using the poisonous stinger at the tip of its tail, one jab of which can put a creature into a catatonic state that can last for hours. Pseudodragons are selective when it comes to choosing companions and bond with a person only as long as it is treated fairly, putting up with no ill treatment. When bonded with an individual a pseudodragon can communicate telepathically even over long distances. They can also vocalize with animal noises, purring with pleasure, hissing for unpleasant surpirses. A chirp represents desire or greeting, and growls anger and discontent.</p>
